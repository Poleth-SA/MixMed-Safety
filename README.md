# MixMed-Safety

## Frontend

The frontend folder contains the client-side code for the MixMed-Safety application. This part of the project is responsible for the user interface and user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

### Setup and Run

To set up and run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
