# How to Run
    1. Start the Backend Server (Flask)
        # Navigate to your backend directory
        cd backend

        # Install Python dependencies (first time only)
        pip install -r requirements.txt

        # Run the Flask server
        python app.py

    2. Start the Frontend Server (React)
        # In a new terminal, navigate to your frontend directory
        cd frontend

        # Install dependencies (first time only)
        npm install

        # Start the development server
        npm run dev

## Important Notes
    - Make sure you have python and Node.js install in your system
    - Keep both servers running while developing
    - You'll need two terminal windows, one for each server
    - The frontend and backend must run simultaneously for the application to work properly
